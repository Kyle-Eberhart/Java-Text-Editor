# Java-Text-Editor
This project is a text editor that has two versions: one implemented with a linked list, the other implemented with a dynamic array.          
The text editor supports traversing the cursor through strings, backspace, delete, etc.

To use the text editor:                                                                                          
1.) Clone this repository                                                                                                       
2.) Open in Eclipse or any Java IDE.                                                                                           
3.) Ensure all files are in the same package "editor".                                                                   
4.) Run either L_StringEditor.java for linked list implementation, or A_StringEditor.java for Dynamic Array implementation.
